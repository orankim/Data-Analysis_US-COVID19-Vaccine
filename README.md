US COVID-19 Vaccination Prediction Analysis and the Correlation With Political Orientation
================================================================================================

### Introduction
- The United States is the country worst hit by COVID-19 and its nation makes up one in four of the worldâ€™s confirmed cases.
- The US desperately accelerated the vaccination rollout across the nation and it now possesses over 40 million doses, which is enough to vaccinate older Americans seeking booster shots and even young children.
-  However, a survey conducted by Kaiser Family Foundation reveals that only 65% of eligible American adults are fully vaccinated and this seems to have a correlation with political orientation. 
-  Similarly, the survey results conducted by The Economist, YouGov shows that 29% of the Republicans chose not to get vaccinated.
